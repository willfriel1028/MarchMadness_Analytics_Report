This file contains a walkthrough/explanation of what an output could look like. For this walkthrough, I decided to take a closer look at this year's (2025) second round matchup between Arizona (4) and Oregon (5). I chose this matchup because from what I saw across a lot of brackets was that people were pretty split on this matchup. Thus, I decided to take a closer look to examine it.

## Arizona(4) vs. Oregon(5)

_______________________________________________

STRENGTH OF SCHEDULE COMPARISON

ELITE SOS
Arizona:     44.259    Oregon:      35.999

WINS ABOVE BUBBLE
Arizona:     5.4    Oregon:      5.3
_______________________________________________
```
This section highlights how challenging each team’s schedule was (Elite SOS) and how well each team performed relative to a typical bubble team (WAB).

**Matchup-specific insights**

Arizona faced tougher competition this season.
Both teams performed very similarly when compared to how a bubble team would perform against their respective schedules.

Since both teams played relatively difficult competition and performed similarly, neither team gains a significant edge here.

**Overall insights**

Elite SOS is mainly important to keep in mind when analyzing statistics further down in the output. If a team has a high Elite SOS and great raw statistics, they are considered the best of the best in that category. However, if a team has a low Elite SOS and great raw statistics, keep in mind that their weaker schedule could be inflating their performance.

In a situation where a team has a significantly higher WAB, it shows that they performed much better throughout the season compared to the other team, even if their statistics seem close.

Make sure to keep Elite SOS in mind when analyzing any statistic that does not take opponent difficulty into account.

_______________________________________________
```
This is one of the most telling sections of the output. It displays each teams Adjusted Offensive/Defensive Efficiency, their Offensive/Defensive Effective FG%, and their Offense vs Defense head-to-head matchup score.

This head-to-head matchup score, gives you an idea of how well each teams' offense matches up with the opposing defense. 

**Matchup-specific insights**

Arizona has an advantage in terms of offensive efficiency
Both teams are very similar in terms of defensive efficiency

Both offensive/defensive EFG% are very similar as well.

The head-to-head matchup scores tell us that Arizona's offense has a slight advantage compared to Oregon's offense. 
It is important to keep in mind that the .13 difference is not as big as it may seem, considering this is a [-1,1] scale.

Arizona’s score of 0.30 suggests they hold a decent offensive advantage when matched up against Oregon’s defense
Oregon’s score of 0.17 is still >0, which suggests that their offense has a slight advantage against Arizona's defense

We can conclude that Arizona's offense has a VERY slight advantage over Oregon's offense from this. Also, this game could be decently high-scoring, with both offenses having an advantage.

**Overall insights**

Both adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency come from KenPom, so it is okay to analyze both at face-value, because strength of opposing defenses is calculated in the score.

Effective offensive/defensive FG% is useful to see how effective a team's offense/defense is, but it does not take strength of opponents into consideration.

From what I have found, off/def EFG% can be useful to help detect upsets, especially if it is a mid-major team playing a Power 5 team. For example, it is common for most Power 5 teams to have higher Adj. Off. Efficiency than most mid-major teams, because they play much tougher opponents. With that being said, if you notice a mid-major team has a slightly lower Adj. Off. Efficiency than a Power 5 team, and they have a significantly higher EFG%, it could be an indicator they actually do have a better offense, but they have not had the opportunity to show it off against top tier defenses. The same logic applies for defense, as well.

It is important to note that not all mid-major teams with a higher off/def EFG% than a Power 5 team will not automatically be better. It is always a guessing game as we know, and it is important to use these stats more as context clues than end-all-be-all.

Each team's Offense vs Defense matchup scores are very telling. It takes the into account the strength of one team's offense against the strength of the other team's defense, and returns a score on a [-1,1] scale. This score represents how well that team's offense should perform against the other team's defense. 

The matchup score uses Adj Off/Def Efficiencyies, so they do take strength of opponents into account.

For these reasons, Offense vs Defense matchup score is the most heavily weighted factor in the Win Percentage algorithm.

This section largely represents each team's offensive playstyle, which could possibly still translate for a worse team playing a better team, it is up for the user to interpret.

3-pointers are important to iterpret when analyzing a matchup because they are the quickest way to generate points. If a team is expected to score significantly more threes than their opponent, they do not need to hit as many shots to outscore them. I think that threes are very helpful for detecting upsets, as well.

WIN PERCENTAGE
Arizona:     59.8 %    Oregon:      40.2 %

```
This section displays each team's win percentage. (Their chance to win the game)

**Matchup specific insights**

According to the algorithm,
     
   Arizona has a 59.8% chance to win this game.
   Oregon has a 40.2% chance to win this game.
   
This matchup appears to be very close, which we would expect to see in a 4 vs 5 matchup. Overall, Arizona has a slight advantage, but according to the algorithm this appears to be a toss-up game favoring Arizona.

**Overall insights**

This is a statistically-driven algorithm which takes all previously mentioned factors into account. It uses all of the head-to-head scores as well as strength of schedule and tempo to calculate this win percentage. It also heavily involves the predictive modeling outputs which will be analyzed next.

Strength of schedule is adequately measured in this algorithm, with its two biggest factors being Offense vs Defense matchup score and Wins above Bubble. Both of these have a lot to do with strength of opponents.

I personally interpret two teams' win percentages like this (generally):

   Team A: 50-60%     Team B: 40-50%
   A true toss-up game.
   
   Team A: 60-68%     Team B: 32-40%
   Anything could happen, but heavily lean towards Team A
   
   Team A: 68-85%     Team B: 15-32%
   More than likely to pick Team A. Would need to see a significant statistical edge somewhere for Team B to pick them.
   
   Team A: 85%+       Team B: 15% or less
   Almost certainly would pick Team A to win.

Seed is important to keep in mind here, however. 
For example, a 5 vs 12 game would usually have the 5 seed having a 65-70% chance of winning. If you run this program and see that a 5 seed only has a 55% chance of winning, that could help you decide if you want to pick a 12 over 5 upset in your bracket.

_______________________________________________
```
This section lays out how each team stacks up, both round-by-round and in terms of projected tournament wins.

Round advancement ranks (Round of 32, Sweet 16, etc.) are based on a logistic regression model that uses historical team data to estimate the probability of advancing to each stage of the tournament. Teams are then ranked relative to all others in the field for that round.

Projected wins come from a Poisson regression model that estimates the average number of wins we expect each team to achieve in this year’s tournament, based on historical patterns. Because this model is not scaled to force totals across teams to equal exactly 63 wins, each year’s projections can vary slightly in aggregate. This means the absolute projected win values should be interpreted cautiously when comparing across different tournament years.

**Matchup-specific insights**

Since this output is meant to analyze a second-round matchup, the most relevant advancement rank to focus on is the Sweet 16 Rank, since the winner of this game would move on to that round.

Arizona ranks 18th in likelihood to reach the Sweet 16. As a 4 seed, their expected placement should be in the 13–16 range, so ranking 18th is slightly worse than expectation. However, their other advancement ranks tell a fuller story: they rate very highly in the Elite 8 (10th overall) and National Champion rank (10th overall). This suggests that while they may not be quite as strong in the 4-seed range for simply getting to the Sweet 16, they have a higher ceiling profile if they do advance.

Oregon comes in at 26th, while a 5 seed is expected to be in the 17–20 range. This puts them well below expectation for a 5 seed. Their later-round ranks (27th, 28th, 30th) confirm a pattern of consistent underperformance relative to historical expectations for this seed line.

Arizona is forecasted at 1.78 wins (#10 overall). This is quite strong for a 4 seed, and their rank (10th overall) suggests they’re closer to the profile of a borderline 3 seed.
Oregon is forecasted at 1.25 wins (#26 overall). This aligns closely with a mid-tier 6 or 7 seed, indicating they are likely overseeded as a 5.

**Overall insights**

These models do not use seed as a feature. Instead, teams are evaluated solely on raw statistical performance. This allows us to see how well a team’s actual profile matches those of past teams that advanced to each round, independent of what the committee assigned them.

Looking at advancement ranks across multiple rounds gives us a detailed picture of a team’s ceiling and floor. For example, some teams fit the mold of those that reliably win one or two games but rarely make deep runs. Others may rank only average for the early rounds but show disproportionately higher ranks for the later rounds — suggesting a higher upside if they advance.

While round ranks show round-specific “fit,” projected wins tend to be the best holistic indicator of a team’s expected performance. This is because wins are much more numerous than spots in specific rounds (63 total wins vs. only 1 champion, 4 Final Four teams, etc.), which gives the model more historical data to work with.

Since projected wins are not scaled year-to-year, totals may not always equal 63 across the field. This means absolute values can’t be directly compared between seasons — but within a given year, the ranks (like Arizona #10 vs. Oregon #26) still provide a strong sense of relative strength.

## CONCLUSION

Given the fact that Arizona has a slight statistical advantage according to the win percentage AND they are much better in terms of Sweet 16 Rank and Projected Wins, this program strongly suggests that Arizona should be chosen to win this game.
