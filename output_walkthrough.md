This file contains a walkthrough/explanation of what an output could look like. For this walkthrough, I decided to take a closer look at this year's (2025) second round matchup between Arizona (4) and Oregon (5). I chose this matchup because from what I saw across a lot of brackets was that people were pretty split on this matchup. Thus, I decided to take a closer look to examine it.

## Arizona(4) vs. Oregon(5)

STRENGTH OF SCHEDULE COMPARISON

ELITE SOS
Arizona:     44.259    Oregon:      35.999

WINS ABOVE BUBBLE
Arizona:     5.4    Oregon:      5.3
_______________________________________________
```
This section highlights how challenging each team’s schedule was (Elite SOS) and how well each team performed relative to a typical bubble team (WAB).

**Matchup-specific insights**

Arizona faced tougher competition this season.
Both teams performed very similarly when compared to how a bubble team would perform against their respective schedules.

Since both teams played relatively difficult competition and performed similarly, neither team gains a significant edge here.

**Overall insights**

Elite SOS is mainly important to keep in mind when analyzing statistics further down in the output. If a team has a high Elite SOS and great raw statistics, they are considered the best of the best in that category. However, if a team has a low Elite SOS and great raw statistics, keep in mind that their weaker schedule could be inflating their performance.

In a situation where a team has a significantly higher WAB, it shows that they performed much better throughout the season compared to the other team, even if their statistics seem close.

Make sure to keep Elite SOS in mind when analyzing any statistic that does not take opponent difficulty into account.

This section displays each team's adjusted tempo

**Matchup-specific insights**

Both teams play at a similar pace - tempo will likely not be a major factor in this game.

**Overall insights**

Tempo alone will not tell you too much generally unless there is a significant gap between tempos (think >10 difference). It is then up to the user to determine which team, if any, will dominate the tempo in that matchup.

_______________________________________________
```
This is one of the most telling sections of the output. It displays each teams Adjusted Offensive/Defensive Efficiency, their Offensive/Defensive Effective FG%, and their Offense vs Defense head-to-head matchup score.

This head-to-head matchup score, gives you an idea of how well each teams' offense matches up with the opposing defense. 

**Matchup-specific insights**

Arizona has an advantage in terms of offensive efficiency
Both teams are very similar in terms of defensive efficiency

Both offensive/defensive EFG% are very similar as well.

The head-to-head matchup scores tell us that Arizona's offense has a slight advantage compared to Oregon's offense. 
It is important to keep in mind that the .18 difference is not as big as it may seem, considering this is a [-1,1] scale.

Arizona’s score of 0.20 suggests they hold a slight offensive advantage when matched up against Oregon’s defense
Oregon’s score of 0.02 is very close to 0, which suggests that their offense and Arizona’s defense are roughly evenly matched

We can conclude that Arizona's offense has a VERY slight advantage over Oregon's offense from this.

**Overall insights**

Both adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency come from KenPom, so it is okay to analyze both at face-value, because strength of opposing defenses is calculated in the score.

Effective offensive/defensive FG% is useful to see how effective a team's offense/defense is, but it does not take strength of opponents into consideration.

From what I have found, off/def EFG% can be useful to help detect upsets, especially if it is a mid-major team playing a Power 5 team. For example, it is common for most Power 5 teams to have higher Adj. Off. Efficiency than most mid-major teams, because they play much tougher opponents. With that being said, if you notice a mid-major team has a slightly lower Adj. Off. Efficiency than a Power 5 team, and they have a significantly higher EFG%, it could be an indicator they actually do have a better offense, but they have not had the opportunity to show it off against top tier defenses. The same logic applies for defense, as well.

It is important to note that not all mid-major teams with a higher off/def EFG% than a Power 5 team will not automatically be better. It is always a guessing game as we know, and it is important to use these stats more as context clues than end-all-be-all.

Each team's Offense vs Defense matchup scores are very telling. It takes the into account the strength of one team's offense against the strength of the other team's defense, and returns a score on a [-1,1] scale. This score represents how well that team's offense should perform against the other team's defense. 

The matchup score uses Adj Off/Def Efficiencyies, so they do take strength of opponents into account.

For these reasons, Offense vs Defense matchup score is the most heavily weighted factor in the Win Percentage algorithm.

This section largely represents each team's offensive playstyle, which could possibly still translate for a worse team playing a better team, it is up for the user to interpret.

3-pointers are important to iterpret when analyzing a matchup because they are the quickest way to generate points. If a team is expected to score significantly more threes than their opponent, they do not need to hit as many shots to outscore them. I think that threes are very helpful for detecting upsets, as well.

This section displays each teams offensive/defensive turnover percentage, as well as their TO Offense vs Defense score.

This head-to-head matchup score gives you an idea of how each offense should be able to prevent turning the ball over against the opposing defense.

**Matchup-specific insights**

Both teams have the same offensive turnover percentage
Oregon has the slightly better defensive turnover percentage

The head-to-head matchup scores suggests that both teams are relatively even in terms of turning the ball over.
Even though Arizona is in the negative and Oregon is positive, the 0.1 difference is relatively insignificant on a [-1,1] scale. 

Arizona's score of -0.06 suggests their offense does not have an advantage or disadvantage in terms of turnovers against Oregon's defense.
Oregon's score of 0.04 suggests their offense does not have an advantage or disadvantage in terms of turnovers against Arizona's defense.

We can not confidently conclude who will turn the ball over less from this.

**Overall insights**

The statistics this section is calculated with do not particularly take strength of opponent's defense into consideration, so make sure to keep each team's Elite SOS in the back of your mind when analyzing this. 

This section largely shows off which teams tend to take care of the ball and force turnovers. If a weaker team is elite in either of those categories, there is a pretty good chance it could translate when playing a stronger team.

It is crucial to analyze turnovers in a matchup because each turnover essentially allows that team to attempt one less shot, which gives them less opportunity to score.

Effective Height is the average height of players that play significant minutes for each team.

This head-to-head matchup score gives an idea of how well each team should be able to grab offensive rebounds against the other team.

**Matchup-specific insights**

Oregon is a slightly taller team overall.

Arizona is a significantly better team at offensive rebounding than Oregon.
Both teams are relatively similar in terms of defensive rebounding.

The head-to-head matchup score suggests that Arizona should have an easier time grabbing offensive rebounds than Oregon.
The score difference of 0.37 is pretty significant.

Arizona's score of 0.52 suggests they have an advantage at grabbing offensive rebounds against Oregon's defense.
Oregon's score of 0.15  suggests they have a very slight advantage at grabbing offensive rebounds against Arizona's defense.

We can conclude that Arizona is likely to grab more offensive rebounds from this.

**Overall insights**

The statistics this section is calculated with do not particularly take strength of opponent's defense into consideration, so make sure to keep each team's Elite SOS in the back of your mind when analyzing this. 

This section largely shows off which teams hustle more for offensive and defensive rebounding. If a weaker team shows that they go for rebounds aggressively it could translate going against a stronger team.

Rebounding is a very overlooked aspect when analyzing a matchup. Each offensive rebound a team gets gives them an extra opportunity to score compared to the opponent. Defensive rebound prevents their ability to do that.

WIN PERCENTAGE
Arizona:     57.5 %    Oregon:      42.5 %
_______________________________________________
```
This section displays each team's win percentage. (Their chance to win the game)

**Matchup specific insights**

According to the algorithm,
     
   Arizona has a 57.5% chance to win this game.
   Oregon has a 42.5% chance to win this game.
   
This matchup appears to be very close, which we would expect to see in a 4 vs 5 matchup. Overall, Arizona has a slight advantage, but according to the algorithm this appears to be a toss-up game.

**Overall insights**

This is a statistically-driven algorithm which takes all previously mentioned factors into account. It uses all of the head-to-head scores as well as strength of schedule and tempo to calculate this win percentage.

Strength of schedule is adequately measured in this algorithm, with its two biggest factors being Offense vs Defense matchup score and Wins above Bubble. Both of these have a lot to do with strength of opponents.

I personally interpret two teams' win percentages like this (generally):

   Team A: 50-60%     Team B: 40-50%
   A true toss-up game.
   
   Team A: 60-68%     Team B: 32-40%
   Anything could happen, but heavily lean towards Team A
   
   Team A: 68-85%     Team B: 15-32%
   More than likely to pick Team A. Would need to see a significant statistical edge somewhere for Team B to pick them.
   
   Team A: 85%+       Team B: 15% or less
   Almost certainly would pick Team A to win.

Seed is important to keep in mind here, however. 
For example, a 5 vs 12 game would usually have the 5 seed having a 65-70% chance of winning. If you run this program and see that a 5 seed only has a 55% chance of winning, that could help you decide if you want to pick a 12 over 5 upset in your bracket.

_______________________________________________
```
This section has a lot to unpack.

It displays where we would expect each team to rank based on their seed, their overall rank to advance to each round of the tournament, and their projected tournament wins (and rank).

Each rank was callculated using a logistic regression with ridge penalty. It uses historic data to analyze each team's chance of advancing to a certain round of the tournament and ranks them based on how they statistically compare with other teams that have reached that round.

The projected wins was calculated using a poisson regression. It uses historical data to estimate how many wins we expect each team to have in the tournament (so the theoretical min and max should be 0 and 6 respectively).

**Matchup-specific insights**

Since this output analyzes a second round matchup, we should analyze the *Sweet 16 Rank*, since we are trying to decide what team will advance to that round.

Arizona is the 11th ranked team to reach the Sweet 16. This is slightly better than we would expect for them as a 4 seed (13-16)
Oregon is the 29th ranked team to reach the Sweet 16. This is much worse than we would expect for them as a 5 seed (17-20)

Arizona is projected to win 1.38 games in the tournament. This ranks them at 11.
Oregon is projected to win 0.81 games in the tournament. This ranks them at 32.

Since Arizona consistently ranks in the 11-13 range, and they are expected to rank 13-16, we can assume that they are very good, and perhaps even slightly underseeded, for a 4 seed.
Since Oregon consistently ranks in the 29-32 range, and they are expected to rank 17-20, we can assume that they are not very good, and probably overseeded, for a 5 seed.

This is one of my favorite parts about this program. Even though these teams seemed evenly matched according to the statistics, it is clear now that Arizona much better matches the mold of a team that would advance in the tournament according to historical data.

**Overall insights**

It is important to keep in mind that these ranks base teams based on how well they fit the mold of teams that advance in the tournament according to historical data.

Seeds were not included in the features, so each team is ranked purely based on their performance, and not enhanced by what a committee may think of them.

Ranks and projected win models use statistical z-scores for their features, not raw statistics, to ensure that the model works similarly on a year-to-year basis. This is useful because, for example, teams will not be given an unfair advantage in more recent years where every team makes more threes than they were back in 2010.

While looking where team rank across all different rounds can give you a better overall picture of where teams rank, I like to hone in on what round the winner would be advancing to. 
This is because for each round the models rank teams based on how well they fit previous teams to advance to that specific round, so there could be an instance, for example, that a team fits an archetype where they should be a lock to win 1 or 2 tournament games and not make it any further. 
A scenario like this would have said team ranking very highly to advance in the first 2 ranks, then they would have a steep drop-off from there on out.

I think that looking at projected wins is the best way to get an overall feel for how each team should perform. 
This is because there is much more wins each year than teams that advance to certain rounds of the tournament
   For example, each season in the dataset there are 63 allotted wins. There is only 1 team that wins the championship, 4 that make the Final 4, etc.
More data allows for more accurate modelling.

If teams' projected wins seem low, remember that the model has to allocate 63 wins across 68 teams, so usually the best teams will be projected 4-5.5 wins.

If there is a year where the best 4-5 teams are projected, for example, in the 4+ range, this would mean the tournament is very top-heavy. (2025)

If there is a year where the best 4-5 teams are projected more towards the 3-4 range, this would mean the tournament is very balanced. Perhaps pick more unexpected teams to go far (2023)

If there is a year where there is a clear cut 1-3 teams that are projected to win much more than the rest of the field, I would for sure pick one of those to win the tournament. (2019)

## CONCLUSION

Given the fact that Arizona has a slight statistical advantage according to the win percentage AND they are much better in terms of Sweet 16 Rank and Projected Wins, this program strongly suggests that Arizona should be chosen to win this game.
